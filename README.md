The Odin Project weather app

In this project I will be creating a web page will allow a user to enter in the name of a city and the web page will display the the current weather data for that city.

Form validation is used to make sure the data the user enters is valid and an API is used to get the weather data to display.

Promises will be used to allow us to trigger the changes to the web page only after the data has been received.

This project showcases the use of web APIs to collect the weather data.
